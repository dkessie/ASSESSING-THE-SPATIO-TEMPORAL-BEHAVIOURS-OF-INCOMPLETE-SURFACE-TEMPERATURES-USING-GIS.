# ASSESSING-THE-SPATIO-TEMPORAL-BEHAVIOURS-OF-INCOMPLETE-SURFACE-TEMPERATURES-USING-GIS-PYTHON CODES
This study aimed to better understand the spatiotemporal behaviors of "incomplete" surface temperatures, a subset of all the active surfaces in urban areas, that are relevant for outdoor thermal comfort assessments.
